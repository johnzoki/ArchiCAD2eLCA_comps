# ArchiCAD2eLCA_comps
## Description
A Python project that imports archicad composites out of ifc and archicad attributes.xml and exports eLCA composites for easy LCA
Currently it just extracts comps of IFC-Walls as Objects or converts given Ã–kobaudat-Material as XML-Files which can be used as imported templates on bauteileditor.de!
## Important Notes
ExtandToStructure should be in IFC-Properties of Psets_WallCommon before export!
