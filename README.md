# ArchiCAD2eLCA_comps
## Description
A Python project that extracts ArchiCAD composites out of IFC4-files and exports eLCA composites for easy LCA
Currently it only extracts comps of IFC-Walls or IFC-Slabs that where made of Ã–kobaudat-Material as XML-Files which can be used for the "imported templates" functionality on bauteileditor.de!
## Important Notes
ExtandToStructure should be in IFC-Properties of Psets_WallCommon before export!
These ArchiCAD Attributes must be given to all materials that wish to be imported to bauteileditor.de:
```
OBD_uuid
OBD_lifeTime
```
These are optional:
```
OBD_lifeTimeDelay
OBD_calcLca
OBD_isExtant
```
## Install via pip
```
python3 -m build
```
```
pip install .
```
